### What the dash is Whack Whack ?

So the story goes! 

I wanted a super title for my blog. It had to be unique and blow people's minds away! 

Not saying that Whack-Whack does that! 

But i am happy about the name. 

When someone says "http://", they say "http slash slash", 
some others say "http whack whack"..since to take a slash at, can be also stated as to take a whack at.  

Since this blog would be writings on the web domain, and more.. i said well how about that? 

And then.. Whack would also stand out for web hacking, essentially specifying things you develop for the web, in a white hat note!

And the <Whack>Web Application Space</Whack>, enclosed in markup tags, would call out to every reader! 

Anyways, honoring http, the web and and the markup, i said let's bring it on! 

And then the Whack-Whack was conceived. 

And some one else asked, why the .info, well why not? 

The domain is cheaper, and all the purpose of the site is to share information! 

Boom. Roasted!
