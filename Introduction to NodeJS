Node.js welcomes you to the world of server side JavaScript!


Today's world offers a bunch of different server side technologies that we could choose from:
C# (ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC)

When it comes to JavaScript on the server side, the current trend and popular solution is Node.js.
Being able to build the complete stack on top of JavaScript delights the community.

Node.js has taken the world by storm and these are the people who are using node.
